# Active Pixel

Active Pixel is an application designed to provide notifications on a user defined schedule or when unproductive periods have occurred.

## Motivation

When working a full time remote job, sometimes you can get caught up in your work and spend an unhealthy amount of time sitting and staring at a computer screen.
The goal is to recommend new activities (exercises, stretches, etc.) throughout the day to stay healthier.
This app isn't only beneficial to remote workers, but to anyone who spends a long time at a computer on any given day (gamers, youtube lovers, etc.).
